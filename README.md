# Redux Workshop

This workshop is designed to get everyone up to speed with the essentials of Redux. It is based on the explanations provided in the Redux
documentation. For a full understanding of how Redux works behind the scenes, I recommend reading both the Redux Fundamentals and Redux Essentials 
tutorials available at https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/overview. Redux Essentials will teach you the abstracted logic of Redux Toolkit (which you should use),
whereas Redux Fundamentals will teach you exactly what's going on behind the scenes. 

This workshop aims to take a bit from both approaches to give you and understanding of what Redux is and how it works, as well as how best to use it.


## Dependencies
Ensure you install the dependencies for the app using `npm install`. The app is created using `create-react-app`, with the following dependencies added:
- `@reduxjs/toolkit` - the star of the show
- `react-redux` - bindings for react
- `json-server` - to let us simulate API calls in a local development environment

## What we'll make
In line with the ancient traditions of tutorials, we'll be making a todo app. This will involve tracking state, sending and receiving data.
